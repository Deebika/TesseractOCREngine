# CaptivaCustomTesseractOCR
Custom Tesseract OCR Engine for Captiva Advanced Recognition

This project uses the Opentext Intelligent Capture OCR SDK to integrate with Tesseract OCR engine.

This works with zonal OCR.
The solution must be compiled to the binnt directory of intelligent capture.
You can then create a custom OCR engine in Recognition Designer.
